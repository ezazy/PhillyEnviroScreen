# PhillyEnviroScreen

This is a final project completed for Geographical Information Sciences III at the University of Chicago.

### Goals and Objectives
The goal of this project is to create a Philidelaphia version of California's CalEnviroScreen3.0, which is a geospatial tool meant to help identify California communitys most affected by pollution and those who are vulnerable to pollution's effects. 

### Motivation
This project


### Data Sources

### Spatial Temporal Scale
The spatial temporal scale I used was U.S. Census blocks. This scale was chosen because it was the most granular, reliable data I could find. Using a smaller scale for analysis allows for a more nuanced view of environmental factors in a relatively smaller city.


### Methods Used

### Results

### Discussion

### Conclusion and Limitations


### Further work

There are a couple of very interestings prospects for further work on creating a Philidelphia environmental justice indicator. One I was interested in, though I thought it was out scope of what my work was in this specific deadline of the project, was using neighborhood charatization data from OpenDataPhilly.  In OpenData Philly there is geospatial data on:
* Philadelphia zones termed as “blighted”
* Choice Neighborhoods “administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). It supports locally driven strategies to address struggling neighborhoods with distressed public” 
* Redevelopment certified areas

Use of this data would be especially interesting to when compared to the historic redlining data, which was one of my original auxiliary goals.
